# AES Encryption App
This repository containts the code of an app that encrypts/decrypts text/files using Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm. I have this appliaction developed for Cryptography course on my university and is one of my favourite projects to this day. It was my first program with GUI (which is extremaly calnky) nevertheless I had a ton of fun making it.
